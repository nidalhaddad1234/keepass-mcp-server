## Usage Examples

### Basic Authentication
```
User: "Please unlock my KeePass database"
Claude: "I'll unlock your KeePass database. Please provide your master password."
User: "MySecurePassword123!"
Claude: "Database unlocked successfully. I can now help you manage your credentials."
```

### Searching Credentials
```
User: "Find my GitHub credentials"
Claude: "I found your GitHub account credentials. The username is 'developer' and I can provide the password when needed."

User: "I need credentials for github.com"
Claude: "I found a matching entry for github.com with username 'developer'. Would you like me to provide the password?"
```

### Creating New Entries
```
User: "Create a new entry for Netflix with username john@email.com and generate a strong password"
Claude: "I've created a new Netflix entry with username 'john@email.com' and generated a secure 16-character password. The entry has been saved to your database."
```

### Managing Groups
```
User: "Create a new group called 'Streaming Services' and move all my entertainment accounts there"
Claude: "I've created the 'Streaming Services' group and moved 4 entertainment accounts (Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Spotify) to this group."
```

### Security Analysis
```
User: "Check my database for weak passwords"
Claude: "I found 3 entries with weak passwords:
1. Old Email Account - password too short
2. Test Account - low complexity
3. Social Media - common password pattern

Would you like me to generate new secure passwords for these accounts?"
```

driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("https://github.com/login")
driver.find_element(By.NAME, "login").send_keys(credentials["username"])
driver.find_element(By.NAME, "password").send_keys(credentials["password"])
driver.find_element(By.NAME, "commit").click()
```

### Playwright Example
```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

credentials = get_credentials_from_claude("github.com")

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch()
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://github.com/login")
    page.fill('input[name="login"]', credentials["username"])
    page.fill('input[name="password"]', credentials["password"])
    page.click('input[name="commit"]')
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database not found:**
```
Error: Database file not found: /path/to/database.kdbx
```
- Verify the `KEEPASS_DB_PATH` environment variable
- Ensure the file exists and is readable
- Check file permissions

**Authentication failed:**
```
Error: Invalid password or key file
```
- Verify master password is correct
- Check key file path if using one
- Ensure key file is readable

**Permission denied:**
```
Error: Operation not allowed in read-only mode
```
- Change `KEEPASS_ACCESS_MODE` to `readwrite`
- Restart the server after configuration change

**Session expired:**
```
Error: Session has expired. Please authenticate again.
```
- Re-authenticate with Claude
- Increase `KEEPASS_SESSION_TIMEOUT` if needed

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:
```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
keepass-mcp-server
```

### Health Check

Check server status:
```bash
# Using the health_check tool through Claude
"Please run a health check on the KeePass server"
```

## Security Considerations

### üîí **Database Security**
- Store your KeePass database in a secure location
- Use strong master passwords (recommended: 20+ characters)
- Consider using key files for additional security
- Regular backups to secure, separate locations

### üõ°Ô∏è **Server Security**
- Run the server with minimal required privileges
- Use read-only mode when write access isn't needed
- Configure appropriate session timeouts
- Monitor audit logs for suspicious activity

### üîê **Network Security**
- Use local deployment when possible
- Secure network connections for remote deployments
- Consider VPN for remote access
- Regular security updates

### üìä **Monitoring**
- Enable audit logging
- Monitor for failed authentication attempts
- Set up alerts for security events
- Regular security assessments

## Performance Optimization

### üöÄ **Configuration Tuning**
- Adjust `CACHE_TIMEOUT` for your usage patterns
- Configure `MAX_CONCURRENT_OPERATIONS` based on load
- Optimize `BACKUP_COUNT` for storage constraints
- Set appropriate session timeouts

### üíæ **Database Optimization**
- Keep database size reasonable (< 100MB recommended)
- Regular cleanup of unused entries
- Optimize group structure for search performance
- Use tags effectively for filtering

### üîç **Search Optimization**
- Use specific search terms when possible
- Leverage group filters to narrow results
- Utilize tags for categorical searches
- Consider entry limits for large datasets
